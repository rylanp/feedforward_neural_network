# feedforward_neural_network
I've used this to predict premier league scores.

1. networkEPL.py runs the network
2. EPL_network_biases_weights.csv stores the current weights and biases
3. epl_scores_data.csv contains example past games
4. epl_teams_data.csv contains example stats
5. Real stats were used, now they are old stats

If you use this, you should use your own stats, and thus change how they are the input to the network in networkEPL.py.
