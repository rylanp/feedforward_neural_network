# feedforward_neural_network
I've used this to predict premier league scores.

1. networkEPL.py runs the network
2. EPL_network_biases_weights.csv stores the current weights and biases
3. epl_scores_data.csv contains example past games
4. epl_teams_data.csv contains example stats
5. Real stats were used, now they are old stats
